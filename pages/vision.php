            Our Vision

             Our vision is simple. We just want to provide people with things to help
             stay happy and not down.<br> During the various lockdowns, we know that people have struggled in various ways. Because of this we offer a variety of things that 
             people can customize and use to stay busy and/or cope wiith the struggles.<br>
             The idea started years ago when the first G-box was created and decorated. Cuztomizing it brought me joy and kept me occupied for a while. Hopefully it can do the same for everyone else.
